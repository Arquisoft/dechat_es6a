== Quality Requirements



****
In this document we will talk about the most important and outstanding quality requirements.

We will start by seeing a quality tree with all these quality requirements, as well as its most significant quality scenarios.

Later you can see in depth the quality scenarios.

=== Quality Tree


****
In this section you can see the quality tree (ATAM) with his most important quality attributes and quality scenarios.

|===
| *Reference* | *AQ* | *Scenario* | *Priority*
| 1 | Portability | The system must be able to operate on different platforms | High, high
| 2 | Performance and usability | A user will send and receive messages instantly to ensure smooth communication | High, high
| 3 | Usability | Facilitate the use and understanding of the system to user | High, medium
| 4 | Realibility and usability | If an error occurs without too much importance the system should continue working | High, high

| 6 | Modifiability | 
The system must be open 2 hours after having made changes in the algorithms and methods that comprise them, without impairing functionality | High, high
| 7 | Scalability | The system must be designed so that, if the number of users increases in a short period of time, the availability and performance is not affected | High, low
| 8 | Scalability | Support for at least "X" mb content | Medium, medium
| 9 | Availability | The system must be accessible at least 90% of the time | Medium, low
