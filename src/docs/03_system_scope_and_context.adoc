== System Scope and Context

.Contents
This project is part of the Software Architecture subject.
Our system scope is the implementation and testing of a descentralized chat using SOLID. For this, we use the architectural style peer-to-peer.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
There are three interested parts:
* **Subject's teachers:** They will evaluate the final project.
* **Inrupt:** The startup that has created the technology that is used (SOLID).
* **Users:** They will use the chat. They can communicate with other users through messages or files, but their communication will not be stored anywhere.

For the diagram we used the tool [plantuml] (http://plantuml.com/es/) .
